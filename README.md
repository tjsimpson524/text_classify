# text_classify

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau publishes the Consumer Complaint Database, a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that were sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. 

You have been provided with a dataset of over 350,000 such complaints for 5 common issue types. Your goal is to train a text classification model to identify the issue type based on the consumer complaint narrative. The data can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hz1gnCCr-SDGjnKgcPbg7Nd3NztOLdxw/view?usp=share_link
